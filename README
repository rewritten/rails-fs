Welcome to rails-fs
===================


rails-fs is a rails app aimed to manage files (including uploads) as references
in db, with the ability to browse "per directory", with an actual tree of
generic "fs_item" objects, which will then specialize as directories or files
with content.

All the system is fully taggable.
